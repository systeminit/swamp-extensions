# @swamp/digitalocean

Auto-generated [swamp](https://github.com/systeminit/swamp) extension models for
DigitalOcean resources.

Each model represents a single DigitalOcean resource (e.g., a Droplet, a volume,
a load balancer). Models have **domain properties** that you configure (the
desired state) and **resource properties** that reflect the live state in
DigitalOcean. Available methods:

- **create** — provision the resource using the configured properties
- **get** — fetch the current state of a specific resource by ID
- **update** — apply property changes to an existing resource
- **delete** — remove the resource from DigitalOcean
- **sync** — refresh all resource properties from the API

Use `swamp model type describe @swamp/digitalocean/<model>` to see the full list
of configurable properties and available methods for a model.

## Authentication

Set the `DO_API_TOKEN` environment variable to your DigitalOcean personal access
token. The token is validated against `/v2/account` on first use.

```bash
export DO_API_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

## Usage

```bash
# Create a new droplet model
swamp model create @swamp/digitalocean/droplet my-droplet

# Edit the model to configure its properties
swamp model edit my-droplet

# Create the resource in DigitalOcean
swamp model method run my-droplet create

# Sync current state from DigitalOcean
swamp model method run my-droplet sync
```
