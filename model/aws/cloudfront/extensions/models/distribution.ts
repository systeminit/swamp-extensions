To specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL ID, for example a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111. WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. For more information about WAF, see the [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html).",
