/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Google Cloud Support Cases.
 *
 * A Case is an object that contains the details of a support case. It contains fields for the time it was created, its priority, its classification, and more. Cases can also have comments and attachments that get added over time. A case is parented by a Google Cloud organization or project. Organizations are identified by a number, so the name of a case parented by an organization would look like this: ``` organizations/123/cases/456 ``` Projects have two unique identifiers, an ID and a number, and they look like this: ``` projects/abc/cases/456 ``` ``` projects/123/cases/456 ``` You can use either of them when calling the API. To learn more about project identifiers, see [AIP-2510](https://google.aip.dev/cloud/2510).
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
