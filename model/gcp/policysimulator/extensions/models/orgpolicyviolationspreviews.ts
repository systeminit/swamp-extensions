/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Policy Simulator OrgPolicyViolationsPreviews.
 *
 * OrgPolicyViolationsPreview is a resource providing a preview of the violations that will exist if an OrgPolicy change is made. The list of violations are modeled as child resources and retrieved via a ListOrgPolicyViolations API call. There are potentially more OrgPolicyViolations than could fit in an embedded field. Thus, the use of a child resource instead of a field.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
