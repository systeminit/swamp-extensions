/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine Addresses.
 *
 * Represents an IP Address resource. Google Compute Engine has two IP Address resources: * [Global (external and internal)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/globalAddresses) * [Regional (external and internal)](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/addresses) For more information, see Reserving a static external IP address.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
