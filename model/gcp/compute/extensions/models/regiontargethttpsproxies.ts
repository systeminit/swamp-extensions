/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine RegionTargetHttpsProxies.
 *
 * Represents a Target HTTPS Proxy resource. Google Compute Engine has two Target HTTPS Proxy resources: * [Global](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/targetHttpsProxies) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionTargetHttpsProxies) A target HTTPS proxy is a component of Google Cloud HTTPS load balancers. * targetHttpsProxies are used by global external Application Load Balancers, classic Application Load Balancers, cross-region internal Application Load Balancers, and Traffic Director. * regionTargetHttpsProxies are used by regional internal Application Load Balancers and regional external Application Load Balancers. Forwarding rules reference a target HTTPS proxy, and the target proxy then references a URL map. For more information, readUsing Target Proxies and Forwarding rule concepts.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
 *
