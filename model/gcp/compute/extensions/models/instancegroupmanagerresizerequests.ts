/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine InstanceGroupManagerResizeRequests.
 *
 * InstanceGroupManagerResizeRequest represents a request to create a number of VMs: either immediately or by queuing the request for the specified time. This resize request is nested under InstanceGroupManager and the VMs created by this request are added to the owning InstanceGroupManager.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
