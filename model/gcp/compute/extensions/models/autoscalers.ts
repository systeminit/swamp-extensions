/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine Autoscalers.
 *
 * Represents an Autoscaler resource. Google Compute Engine has two Autoscaler resources: * [Zonal](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/autoscalers) * [Regional](/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/regionAutoscalers) Use autoscalers to automatically add or delete instances from a managed instance group according to your defined autoscaling policy. For more information, read Autoscaling Groups of Instances. For zonal managed instance groups resource, use the autoscaler resource. For regional managed instance groups, use theregionAutoscalers resource.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
