 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Compute Engine InterconnectAttachments.

 * Represents an Interconnect Attachment (VLAN) resource. You can use Interconnect attachments (VLANS) to connect your Virtual Private Cloud networks to your on-premises networks through an Interconnect. For more information, read Creating VLAN Attachments.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
