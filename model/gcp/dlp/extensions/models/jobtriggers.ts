For a match to occur, the entire file path (i.e., everything in the url after the bucket name) must match the regular expression. For example, given the input `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory1/.*"], exclude_regex: ["directory1/excluded.*"]}`: * `gs://mybucket/directory1/myfile` will be included * `gs://mybucket/directory1/directory2/myfile` will be included (`.*` matches across `/`) * `gs://mybucket/directory0/directory1/myfile` will _not_ be included (the full path doesn\'t match any items in `include_regex`) * `gs://mybucket/directory1/excludedfile` will _not_ be included (the path matches an item in `exclude_regex`) If `include_regex` is left empty, it will match all files by default (this is equivalent to setting `include_regex: [".*"]`). Some other common use cases: * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", exclude_regex: [".*\\.pdf"]}` will include all files in `mybucket` except for.pdf files * `{bucket_name: "mybucket", include_regex: ["directory/[^/]+"]}` will include all files directly under `gs://mybucket/directory/`, without matching across `/`',
