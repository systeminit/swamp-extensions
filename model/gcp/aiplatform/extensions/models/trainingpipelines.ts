If you don't specify this field, it defaults to the following value when you deploy this Model to an Endpoint: /v1/endpoints/ENDPOINT/deployedModels/ DEPLOYED_MODEL:predict The placeholders in this value are replaced as follows: * ENDPOINT: The last segment (following `endpoints/`)of the Endpoint.name][] field of the Endpoint where this Model has been deployed.

In other words, the prediction has the original instance data first, followed by the actual prediction content (as per the schema). The possible formats are: * `jsonl` The JSON Lines format, where each prediction is a single line. Uses GcsDestination. * `csv` The CSV format, where each prediction is a single comma-separated line. The first line in the file is the header, containing comma-separated field names. Uses GcsDestination. * `bigquery` Each prediction is a single row in a BigQuery table, uses BigQueryDestination. If this Model doesn't support any of these formats it means it cannot be used with a BatchPredictionJob. However, if it has supported_deployment_resources_types, it could serve online predictions by using PredictionService.Predict or PredictionService.Explain.",
