The wildcard label must appear by itself as the first label. Hostname can be "precise" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. `foo.example.com`) or "wildcard", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. `*.example.com`).

The routes associated with a Mesh or Gateways must have unique hostnames. If you attempt to attach multiple routes with conflicting hostnames, the configuration will be rejected.
