/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Pub/Sub Subscriptions.
 *
 * A subscription resource. If none of `push_config`, `bigquery_config`, `cloud_storage_config`, or `bigtable_config` is set, then the subscriber will pull and ack messages using API methods. At most one of these fields may be set.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.
