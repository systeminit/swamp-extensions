 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud AI Platform Training & Prediction Models.Versions.

 * Represents a version of the model. Each version is a trained model deployed in the cloud, ready to handle prediction requests. A model can have multiple versions. You can get information about all of the versions of a given model by calling projects.models.versions.list.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
