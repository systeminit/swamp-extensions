/**
 * Swamp extension model for Google Cloud Tool Results Histories.Executions.Steps.
 *
 * A Step represents a single operation performed as part of Execution. A step can be used to represent the execution of a tool ( for example a test runner execution or an execution of a compiler). Steps can overlap (for instance two steps might have the same start time if some operations are done in parallel). Here is an example, let's consider that we have a continuous build is executing a test runner for each iteration. The workflow would look like: - user creates a Execution with id 1 - user creates a TestExecutionStep with id 100 for Execution 1 - user update TestExecutionStep with id 100 to add a raw xml log + the service parses the xml logs and returns a TestExecutionStep with updated TestResult(s). - user update the status of TestExecutionStep with id 100 to COMPLETE A Step can be updated until its state is set to COMPLETE at which points it becomes immutable.
 *
 * Wraps the GCP resource as a swamp model so create, get, update,
 * delete, and sync can be driven through `swamp model`.

Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo:= &pb.Foo{...} any, err:= ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)... foo:= &pb.Foo{} if err:= ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err!= nil {... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use \'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name\' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last \'/\' in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z". # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.

Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go foo:= &pb.Foo{...} any, err:= ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)... foo:= &pb.Foo{} if err:= ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err!= nil {... } The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use \'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name\' as the type URL and the unpack methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last \'/\' in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type name "y.z". # JSON The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example: package google.profile; message Person { string first_name = 1; string last_name = 2; } { "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person", "firstName":, "lastName": } If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type` field.
