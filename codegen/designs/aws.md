# AWS Provider Design

## 1. Purpose

Clover's AWS provider reads the CloudFormation Resource Provider schemas and
generates a set of swamp extension models — one per CloudFormation resource
type. Each model is a self-contained TypeScript file that exports a `model`
object with Zod schemas and CRUD methods. A shared `_lib/aws.ts` file provides
the CloudControl API client, retry logic, polling, and CRUD helpers.

Unlike the Hetzner and DigitalOcean providers (which use REST APIs with
provider-specific HTTP clients), the AWS provider uses the
[CloudControl API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html)
— a single unified API that provides CRUD operations for all CloudFormation
resource types. This means one helper library works for all 1300+ resource
types.

**Output**: `outputs/aws/{service}/` — one directory per AWS service,
containing:

- `extensions/models/*.ts` — one file per resource type (e.g., `instance.ts`,
  `vpc.ts`)
- `extensions/models/_lib/aws.ts` — shared CloudControl helpers
- `manifest.yaml` — extension package manifest

**How to run**:

```sh
deno task fetch-schema:aws    # download CloudFormation schemas
deno task generate:aws        # generate models from the local schemas
```

The pipeline is orchestrated by `src/commands/generateModels.ts`, which calls
`generateAwsModels()` from the pipeline, writes all files per service, runs
`deno fmt`, and reports changes.

---

## 2. Schema Source

The schemas are fetched from the CloudFormation schema registry:

```
https://schema.cloudformation.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/CloudformationSchema.zip
```

The zip contains one JSON file per resource type (e.g.,
`aws-ec2-instance.json`). The pipeline extracts all `aws-*` files, applies
fixes, and consolidates them into `schemas/cf-schema.json`.

### Schema pre-processing

1. **Reference fix**: CloudFormation schemas use `resource-schema.json#` as a
   base URI for `$ref` pointers. This is replaced with `#` to make pointers
   self-referential within each schema.

2. **Special-case patch**: The EC2 VerifiedAccessTrustProvider schema has a
   problematic `SseSpecification` definition that causes dereferencing issues.
   It is removed during extraction.

3. **Sorting**: Schemas are sorted by `typeName` for deterministic output.

### $ref dereferencing

After loading `cf-schema.json`, each schema is dereferenced using
`@apidevtools/json-schema-ref-parser`. During dereferencing, the `onDereference`
callback stamps each resolved reference with a `title` derived from its
definition name. This title is used later by the Zod generator to create named
extracted schemas (e.g., `TagSchema`, `BlockDeviceMappingSchema`).

Circular references are handled by the parser's `circular: "ignore"` option.

### What gets skipped

| Schema                                 | Reason                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`                 | `oneOf` array without title        |
| `AWS::KinesisAnalyticsV2::Application` | Unsupported string regexp pattern  |
| `AWS::SMSVOICE::PhoneNumber`           | Unsupported string regexp pattern  |
| `AWS::SMSVOICE::Pool`                  | Unsupported string regexp pattern  |
| `AWS::MediaConnect::Flow`              | Unsupported number format: `int32` |
| Non-`AWS::` / non-`Alexa::` schemas    | Not AWS resources                  |
| Schemas without a `read` handler       | CF-only resources with no read API |

The `read` handler requirement ensures every generated model can retrieve
current state after creation. Without it, the CRUD pattern is incomplete.
Approximately 201 schemas are skipped for lacking a read handler.

---

## 3. Resource Discovery

### CloudFormation handler-based discovery

Unlike the Hetzner and DigitalOcean providers (which discover resources from
OpenAPI path analysis), the AWS provider discovers resources from the
CloudFormation schema's `handlers` field. Each CF schema declares which CRUD
handlers the resource supports:

```json
{
  "handlers": {
    "create": { "permissions": ["ec2:RunInstances", ...] },
    "read": { "permissions": ["ec2:DescribeInstances", ...] },
    "update": { "permissions": ["ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute", ...] },
    "delete": { "permissions": ["ec2:TerminateInstances", ...] }
  }
}
```

A resource is included if it has at least a `read` handler. The generated model
includes only the methods for which handlers exist:

| Handler  | Generated method |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `create` | `create`         |
| `read`   | `get`            |
| `update` | `update`         |
| `delete` | `delete`         |

### Per-service grouping

Resources are grouped by the second segment of the CloudFormation type name:

| Type name                 | Service  | Resource file       | Model slug       |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| `AWS::EC2::Instance`      | `ec2`    | `instance.ts`       | `instance`       |
| `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup` | `ec2`    | `security_group.ts` | `security-group` |
| `AWS::S3::Bucket`         | `s3`     | `bucket.ts`         | `bucket`         |
| `AWS::Lambda::Function`   | `lambda` | `function.ts`       | `function`       |

Each service produces an independent publishable extension package:
`@swamp/aws/ec2`, `@swamp/aws/s3`, `@swamp/aws/lambda`, etc.

### Why per-service splitting

A single `@swamp/aws` package with 1300+ models would be impractical:

- Users typically work with a handful of services, not all of AWS
- Individual service packages can be versioned independently
- Smaller packages are faster to install and load
- Aligns with how AWS itself organizes services

### What AWS doesn't need

Unlike the Hetzner and DigitalOcean providers, there is no:

- **Path-based resource discovery** — resources come from CF schemas, not URLs
- **Action methods** — CloudControl handles all operations uniformly
- **Sub-resource methods** — each CF type is a standalone resource
- **Discovery endpoints** — no equivalent concept
- **Response envelope unwrapping** — CloudControl returns JSON properties
  directly
- **HTTP method precedence** — all operations go through CloudControl commands

---

## 4. Property Splitting

### Domain vs resource properties

The pipeline splits each CF schema's properties into two sets:

**Domain properties** (writable): Properties the user provides when creating or
updating a resource. Read-only properties are excluded. These become the
`GlobalArgsSchema`.

**Resource properties** (all): Every property the API returns, including
read-only fields like `Arn`, `VpcId`, etc. These become the `StateSchema`.

```typescript
function splitAwsProperties(schema, onlyProperties) {
  domainProperties = pruneProperties(schema.properties, readOnlySet);
  resourceValueProperties = schema.properties; // ALL properties
  return { domainProperties, resourceValueProperties };
}
```

### Why resource schema includes everything

AWS CloudControl's `GetResource` returns all properties — both writable inputs
and read-only outputs. The resource schema must accept all of them. If it only
included writable properties, read-only fields like `InstanceId` or `Arn` would
be silently dropped during parsing.

### Property classification from CF schema

CloudFormation schemas declare property classifications using JSON Pointer
arrays:

| CF schema field        | Meaning                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `readOnlyProperties`   | Set by AWS after creation (e.g., `Arn`, `Id`) |
| `createOnlyProperties` | Can only be set at creation (e.g., `ImageId`) |
| `writeOnlyProperties`  | Not returned in read (e.g., `Password`)       |
| `primaryIdentifier`    | Fields that uniquely identify the resource    |

These JSON Pointer paths (e.g., `/properties/InstanceId`) are normalized to
simple field names (`InstanceId`) by `normalizeOnlyProperties()`.

### Create-only property handling

Properties in `createOnlyProperties` can be set during creation but not changed
via update. The update method passes these to `updateResource()` which filters
them from the JSON patch:

```typescript
const rawPatch = jsonpatch.compare(currentState, desiredState);
const patch = rawPatch.filter((op) => {
  const topLevelProp = op.path.split("/")[1];
  return !createOnlySet.has(topLevelProp);
});
```

This prevents CloudControl from rejecting update requests that attempt to modify
immutable properties.

---

## 5. Identifying Field Resolution

### Primary identifier from CF schema

Every CloudFormation schema declares a `primaryIdentifier` — one or more JSON
Pointer paths that uniquely identify the resource:

```json
{ "primaryIdentifier": ["/properties/BucketName"] }
{ "primaryIdentifier": ["/properties/VpcId"] }
{ "primaryIdentifier": ["/properties/RouteTableId", "/properties/CidrBlock"] }
```

### Single vs composite identifiers

Most resources have a single primary identifier field. Some have composite
identifiers — multiple fields that together form the unique key. The
CloudControl API requires composite identifiers to be joined with `|`:

```
RouteTableId|CidrBlock → "rtb-123|0.0.0.0/0"
PublicIp|AllocationId → "1.2.3.4|eipalloc-abc"
```

The update method handles this by extracting all identifier fields from existing
state and joining them:

```typescript
const idParts = [
  existing.RouteTableId?.toString(),
  existing.CidrBlock?.toString(),
];
const identifier = idParts.join("|");
```

### Identifier types are always strings

Unlike DigitalOcean (which uses numeric IDs, UUIDs, names, and IPs), the
CloudControl API always accepts and returns identifiers as strings. The `get`
and `delete` methods always take `identifier: z.string()`.

### Why no identifier map is needed

CloudFormation schemas explicitly declare primary identifiers — no guessing or
mapping is required. This eliminates the need for DigitalOcean's
`IDENTIFIER_MAP`, `ENDPOINT_IDENTIFIER_OVERRIDES`, and fallback logic.

---

## 6. Factory Pattern and Instance Naming

Every model uses a **factory pattern**: a single model definition can manage
multiple instances of the same resource type. Each instance is identified by a
name, enabling CEL expressions like:

```
data.latest("prod-vpc", "prod-vpc").attributes.VpcId
```

### `resolveNamingField`: preference order

1. **Writable primary identifier** — if the primary identifier field is writable
   (not read-only) and exists in the schema properties, use it directly.
   Example: `BucketName` for S3 Bucket, `KeyPairName` for EC2 KeyPair.
2. **Synthetic `name`** — if the primary identifier is read-only (e.g.,
   `InstanceId`, `VpcId`) or composite, inject a synthetic `name` field into
   GlobalArgs.

### Why most AWS resources use synthetic names

Unlike Hetzner and DigitalOcean (where most resources have a `name` field), most
AWS resources use read-only identifiers assigned by AWS (e.g., `i-0abc123`,
`vpc-0def456`). The user doesn't choose these values — AWS generates them.
Consequently, most AWS models use synthetic names.

Examples:

| Resource          | Primary ID    | Read-only? | Naming field |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| EC2 Instance      | `InstanceId`  | Yes        | Synthetic    |
| EC2 VPC           | `VpcId`       | Yes        | Synthetic    |
| EC2 KeyPair       | `KeyPairName` | No         | Natural      |
| S3 Bucket         | `BucketName`  | No         | Natural      |
| EC2 SecurityGroup | `GroupId`     | Yes        | Synthetic    |
| EC2 EIP           | Composite     | —          | Synthetic    |

### How instance names flow through methods

| Method   | Instance name source                                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `create` | Natural: `result.{field} ?? g.{field}`, Synthetic: `g.name ?? "current"`                    |
| `get`    | Natural: `result.{field} ?? globalArgs.{field}`, Synthetic: `globalArgs.name ?? identifier` |
| `update` | Natural: `g.{field} ?? "current"`, Synthetic: `g.name ?? "current"`                         |
| `delete` | `args.identifier` (uses the identifier as the instance name for the deletion record)        |

### Synthetic name exclusion from API calls

When a synthetic `name` field is used, it is excluded from the `desiredState`
sent to the CloudControl API:

```typescript
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(g)) {
  if (key === "name") continue; // synthetic — not an AWS property
  if (value !== undefined) desiredState[key] = value;
}
```

This prevents sending an unknown `name` property that would cause the API to
reject the request.

---

## 7. CloudControl API Interaction

### Why CloudControl instead of service-specific APIs

The CloudControl API is a single unified API that provides CRUD for all
CloudFormation resource types. This means one helper library (`_lib/aws.ts`)
works for all 1300+ resource types, instead of generating service-specific HTTP
clients with custom request/response handling for each service.

### Operation flow

**Create**: `CreateResourceCommand` with serialized desired state → poll
`GetResourceRequestStatus` until terminal → `GetResourceCommand` to read the
created resource's properties.

**Read**: `GetResourceCommand` with type name and identifier → parse the
`Properties` JSON string from the response.

**Update**: `GetResourceCommand` to read current state → compute JSON patch
between current and desired state → filter create-only properties from the patch
→ `UpdateResourceCommand` with the patch document → poll until terminal →
`GetResourceCommand` to read the updated resource.

**Delete**: `DeleteResourceCommand` with type name and identifier → poll until
terminal → return `{ existed: true }`. If the resource is already gone, return
`{ existed: false }`.

### JSON patch for updates

CloudControl updates use
[RFC 6902 JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) rather than
full state replacement. The pipeline uses `fast-json-patch` to compute the diff
between current and desired state:

```typescript
const rawPatch = jsonpatch.compare(currentState, desiredState);
```

Create-only properties are filtered from the patch before sending. If no patch
operations remain after filtering, the update is skipped and current state is
returned.

### Retry and polling

**Retry**: All CloudControl commands are wrapped in `withRetry()` which retries
on throttling errors with exponential backoff + jitter. Up to 20 attempts with
delays from 1s to 90s.

**Polling**: Async operations (create, update, delete) return a request token.
`pollOperationStatus()` polls `GetResourceRequestStatus` up to 60 times with
exponential backoff until the operation reaches a terminal state (`SUCCESS`,
`FAILED`, or `CANCEL_COMPLETE`).

### Error handling

| Error type          | Detection                                  | Behavior                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Throttling          | `Throttling`, `TooManyRequests` in message | Retry with backoff          |
| Not found (read)    | `was not found`, `does not exist`          | Throw error                 |
| Not found (delete)  | Same patterns                              | Return `{ existed: false }` |
| Operation failed    | `FAILED` status from poll                  | Throw with status message   |
| Operation cancelled | `CANCEL_COMPLETE` from poll                | Throw with message          |

### Client configuration

The CloudControl client reads the AWS region from `AWS_REGION` environment
variable, defaulting to `us-east-1`. AWS credentials are resolved by the SDK's
default credential chain (environment variables, shared credentials file,
instance profiles, etc.).

---

## 8. Sync Method

Every generated model includes a `sync` method for drift detection. Unlike `get`
(which requires the resource identifier as an argument), `sync` reads the
identifier from stored state, making it zero-arg and suitable for automated
workflows.

### How sync works

1. Read the instance name from `globalArgs` (same as `update`)
2. Load existing state via `context.dataRepository.getContent()`
3. Extract the identifier from existing state (handles composite IDs by joining
   with `|`, same as `update`)
4. Call `readResource(typeName, identifier)` in a try/catch
5. On success: write refreshed state to `"state"` resource
6. On `isResourceNotFoundError`: write a `not_found` marker instead of throwing

### Not-found marker

When the resource no longer exists in AWS, sync writes:

```typescript
{
  identifier: "vpc-0abc123",
  status: "not_found",
  syncedAt: "2026-03-08T12:00:00.000Z",
}
```

This allows workflows to detect drift without catching exceptions.

### Exported `isResourceNotFoundError`

The `_lib/aws.ts` helper exports `isResourceNotFoundError()` so that sync
methods can catch 404-equivalent errors from CloudControl. The function detects
`ResourceNotFoundException`, `"was not found"`, and `"does not exist"` patterns.

### Composite identifier handling

Sync handles composite identifiers the same way as `update` — extracting all
primary identifier fields from existing state and joining with `|`:

```typescript
const idParts = [
  existing.RouteTableId?.toString(),
  existing.CidrBlock?.toString(),
];
const identifier = idParts.join("|");
```

---

## 9. Zod Schema Generation

Each generated model contains three Zod schemas. The Zod generation is shared
with Hetzner and DigitalOcean via `src/codegen/zodGenerator.ts`.

### GlobalArgsSchema — full fidelity input validation

Used for create/update arguments. Preserves all CloudFormation constraints:

- String enums → `z.enum(["a", "b"])`
- `minLength`/`maxLength` → `z.string().min(n).max(n)`
- `pattern` → `z.string().regex(new RegExp(...))`
- Integer enums → `z.union([z.literal(1), z.literal(2)])`
- `minimum`/`maximum` → `z.number().min(n).max(n)`
- `integer` → `z.number().int()`
- Nested objects with typed properties and per-field optionality

Required fields (from `cfSchema.required`) are non-optional; everything else
gets `.optional()`.

### StateSchema — simplified response parsing

Used to parse CloudControl API responses. **No constraints, `.passthrough()`**:

- All types are bare: `z.string()`, `z.number()`, `z.boolean()`
- No enums, no min/max, no patterns
- Primary identifier fields are non-optional; everything else is `.optional()`
- `.passthrough()` on the object to allow unknown fields

### Why the distinction

**Input schemas validate user-provided data** — strict constraints prevent bad
API calls. **State schemas parse API responses** — the API may return data that
doesn't match creation constraints (e.g., a deprecated enum value, a field
widened server-side). Applying creation-time constraints to response parsing
would cause false rejections.

### InputsSchema

Mirrors GlobalArgsSchema but with all fields `.optional()`. Used for the swamp
inputs mechanism where partial overrides are provided separately from
globalArgs.

### Extracted schemas

The Zod generator extracts nested object types into top-level named schemas when
they have a `title` from the CF schema. This avoids deep inline nesting and
allows reuse:

```typescript
export const TagSchema = z.object({
  Key: z.string(),
  Value: z.string(),
});

const GlobalArgsSchema = z.object({
  Tags: z.array(TagSchema).optional(),
});
```

### Schema name collision avoidance

The internal state schema is named `StateSchema` rather than `ResourceSchema` to
avoid collisions with extracted schemas. Some CloudFormation types have nested
objects titled "Resource" which would produce an extracted `ResourceSchema`. If
an extracted schema named `StateSchema` exists, the internal schema is renamed
to `_StateSchema`.

### PCRE to JavaScript regex conversion

CloudFormation schemas use PCRE patterns. The `pcreToRegexp()` utility converts
these to JavaScript-compatible `RegExp` patterns, handling PCRE flags (`(?i)`,
`(?m)`, `(?s)`), non-capturing groups, and other PCRE-specific syntax.

Some schemas produce regex patterns containing control character escapes (e.g.,
`\x00`). The generator detects these and adds `no-control-regex` to the
file-level lint ignore directive. Detection strips `.describe()` strings first
to avoid false positives from documentation text that mentions control character
ranges.

### Property normalization: `oneOf`/`anyOf` handling

CloudFormation schemas use `oneOf` and `anyOf` for polymorphic properties. The
normalizer handles these by:

1. **`oneOf` with objects**: Merge all branch properties into a single object
   (union of fields)
2. **`oneOf` with arrays**: Extract the array variant
3. **`oneOf` with empty objects**: Fall back to `z.string()` (JSON type)
4. **`anyOf` with titled objects**: Create named properties from each branch
5. **`anyOf` with non-objects**: Fall back to `z.string()`

---

## 10. Versioning and Change Detection

The AWS pipeline uses the same shared CalVer versioning system as Hetzner and
DigitalOcean (see `src/pipeline/version.ts`).

### CalVer format

Versions use calendar versioning: `YYYY.MM.DD.micro` (e.g., `2026.03.08.2`).

- The date prefix is computed from the current date
- The micro version starts at 1 for new files
- If the date matches the existing version's date, micro is incremented
- If the date is different, micro resets to 1

### Content normalization for comparison

Before comparing, the pipeline:

1. Formats the candidate code with `deno fmt` (ensures whitespace differences
   don't cause false changes)
2. Replaces the version string in both existing and candidate with a placeholder
3. Compares the normalized strings

### Per-service manifest versioning

Each service's manifest versions independently. A manifest is only written when
at least one model in that service has changed. Release notes list which models
were added or updated.

### Idempotency

Running the pipeline twice with no spec changes produces identical output — no
git diff. The version is content-based: same content → same version regardless
of when the pipeline runs.

### Model export shape

Every model file exports `const model = { ... }` with:

```typescript
export const model = {
  type: "@swamp/aws/ec2/instance",       // unique type identifier
  version: "2026.03.08.2",               // CalVer
  globalArguments: GlobalArgsSchema,      // Zod: create/update args
  inputsSchema: InputsSchema,            // Zod: optional overrides
  resources: {
    state: {
      description: "EC2 Instance resource state",
      schema: StateSchema,
      lifetime: "infinite",
      garbageCollection: 10,              // minutes
    },
  },
  methods: {
    create: { ... },                      // if create handler exists
    get: { ... },                         // if read handler exists
    update: { ... },                      // if update handler exists
    delete: { ... },                      // if delete handler exists
    sync: { ... },                        // always present
  },
};
```

### Shared lib (`_lib/aws.ts`)

Exports: `createResource`, `readResource`, `updateResource`, `deleteResource`

Key behaviors:

- CloudControl client reads `AWS_REGION` env var (default: `us-east-1`)
- All commands use exponential backoff + jitter retry on throttling
- Async operations (create, update, delete) poll until terminal state
- Update computes JSON patch internally, filtering create-only properties
- Delete returns `{ existed: false }` for already-deleted resources
- No response envelope unwrapping needed (CloudControl returns JSON properties)

The same `_lib/aws.ts` file is written into every service directory. The content
is identical across services — it's a static helper, not service-specific.

### Naming conventions

| Aspect      | Convention                           | Example                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| File name   | PascalCase → snake_case from CF type | `security_group.ts`             |
| Model slug  | PascalCase → kebab-case from CF type | `security-group`                |
| Type string | `@swamp/aws/{service}/{slug}`        | `@swamp/aws/ec2/security-group` |
| Description | `{Service} {ResourceName}`           | `EC2 SecurityGroup`             |

### Manifest

## 12. Lint Handling

### `no-explicit-any`

All generated models use `any` for the execute function's context parameter (the
swamp execution context type is not available as an import). Every file includes
`// deno-lint-ignore-file no-explicit-any`.

### `no-control-regex`

Some CloudFormation schemas define regex patterns containing control character
escapes (e.g., `\x00`, `\u0009`). The generator detects these by:

1. Joining all generated schema body content
2. Stripping `.describe("...")` strings (which may mention control characters in
   documentation text without actually using them in regex)
3. Checking for `\\x0N`, `\\x1N`, `\\u000N`, `\\u001N` patterns
   (double-backslash escapes that the RegExp engine interprets as control
   characters)
